This PlantUML diagram represents the low-level design for the Smart Bike Rental App, with 5 packages:

1. **UserManagement**: Handles user information and operations, including user registration, login, and payment.
2. **BikeManagement**: Handles bike listings and operations, including bike rental and return.
3. **RentalManagement**: Handles bike rental and operations, including rental requests and ends.
4. **NotificationManagement**: Handles push notifications and operations, including send and get notifications.
5. **SupportManagement**: Handles support requests and operations, including report issues.

Each package contains 4 classes, and relationships are defined between packages using PlantUML's arrow notation.
